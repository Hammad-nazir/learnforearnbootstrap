        <p class="lead">I am taking Intiative About Different Programming Languages in Software Devolpment.The development of the personal computer brought about tremendous changes for
business, industry, science, and education. A similar revolution is occurring in data
communications and networking. Technological advances are making it possible for
communications links to carry more and faster signals. As a result, services are evolving
to allow use of this expanded capacity. For example, established telephone services
such as conference calling, call waiting, voice mail, and caller ID have been extended.Data Organized in Data Structures
using Different Structures Like Arrays,Linklist,Stacks And Queues But Arrays And Linklist Are
two Basic Structures.We will Perform Some Opertions on Data Like Insertion,Sorting etc.The (binary)  heap data structure is an array object  that  we can view as a
nearly complete binary tree    Each
node of the tree corresponds to an element  of the array.    The tree is com-
pletely ﬁlled on all levels except  possibly the lowest,  which is ﬁlled from the
left up to a point.

        <p class="lead">Our Instructors Will Explain You About Data Organizing Ways And Its Structures.When	you	create	your	web	pages	you	have	to	give	them	file	names	of	course.		There	are	a
couple	of	things	that	you	should	be	aware	of	when	you	decide	on	your	file	and	folder
names.First,	there	are	essentially	two	types	of	web	server:	Linux	and	Windows	based.		The	file
and	folder	names	on	Linux	web	servers	are	case	sensitive,	while	windows	are	not	case
sensitive.The	file	extension	for	a	web	page	should	be	htm	or	html			You	may	come	across	other	file
extensions	such	as	php	for	the	PHP	programming	language,	or	.aspx	for	the	dot	net
programming	language,	but	for	all	our	work	we	will	be	using	htm	or	html
Web	sites	can	consist	of	a	very	large	number	of	files	and	folders	and	normally	we	create
folders	to	make	logical	structures.There	are	now	many	well	documented	techniques	for	this	and	as	HTML	5
becomes	more	established,	we	will	probably	see	much	more	use	of	different	media	such	as
video	as	well	as	graphics.

        <p class="lead">My Mission is to impower youth of My Country in Different Latest Technologies.Graphic Design have Very Large Scope.The most important thing that your logo does is help your customers recognize and remember 
your business or product.
 If you want to see this in action, have a friend pour you a glass 
of Coca-Cola and a second glass of Pepsi Cola. Then hide 
the bottles.Can you tell which cola is which just by looking at the brown 
izzy liquid in a glass.Neither can anyone else. But if the glass or bottle has a logo, you immediate know which 
cola you prefer.Your logo works the same way. It helps customers remember 
feelings and experiences associated with your business. If those interactions are positive, clients are likely to return when they need your service again.  • you want to look more professional.
        you have one or more competitors offering a similar product or service and you want to  
         stand out and get noticed.
        you use business cards, a website, or other marketing materials and want to         
         demonstrate that you are qualiied and competent.
        you want to raise money from investors or sell your business someday.
        you want to grow your “brand” and sell additional products and services, or franchise.
         you want customers to remember you.
